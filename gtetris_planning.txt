Planning document: Gravity Tetris
Idea: A game of tetris that, instead of causing pieces to fall by a set increment with each timesteap, allows them to accelerate in response to a gravitational force, which will increase with level.
Purpose: fleshing out understanding of basic Java graphics and key input, learning simple FSM design (menu, gameplay, gameover states, etc), optimization for better performance/less memory usage, generally getting good
Implementation:
	Menu
		New game
		High scores
		Start from level (x)
	Levels
		Probably 1-10 as with original Tetris
		Increase after certain score
			change:
				background
				gravity coeff.
				music(?)
	Scoring
		Per block placed
		Per row erased
		After certain score, increase level
	Game modes (?)
